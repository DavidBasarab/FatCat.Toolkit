 *	What do we need to test to ensure we can use this as a proxy?
 *		- Redirect of get, post, and delete
 *			-- These all  works
 *		- Redirect of Meta Data to a different endpoint than everything else
 *		- This is really a test of redirect period, so can a redirect be done to a different endpoint
 *		- Can do we logic in the redirect to completely replace what NetworkManager is dong?
 *			-- This cannot replace network manager proxy it is only called with the routing at start up
 *
 *	How to configure in code rather than JSON
