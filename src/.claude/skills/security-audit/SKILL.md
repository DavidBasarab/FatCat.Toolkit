name: security-audit
description: Roll up every security review report in vulnerabilities/ (unresolved and resolved) into a single security-posture audit — scan cadence, findings by severity over time, time-to-resolution, current open findings, and an honest statement of methodology and limits. Use when the user says "run a security audit", "security posture", "how secure is the code", "summarize the security reviews", or wants evidence to show an external party. Writes the audit to vulnerabilities/audits/ unless screen-only output is requested. This skill reads reports and git history only — it never edits source code, never creates or modifies review reports, and never moves anything between unresolved/ and resolved/.

# Security Audit

Aggregate the full history of `/code-security-review` reports into one audit document that answers: **how secure is this library, and can we show our work?** The audience is a skeptical external reader — often a team deciding whether to take a dependency on `FatCat.Toolkit`. Write for them, not for the team.

This skill is read-only over everything except its own output folder. It never runs a new review (that is `/code-security-review`), never edits reports, and never resolves findings.

## Step 0 — Choose the output mode

- **File mode (default):** write the audit to `vulnerabilities/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss>-audit.md`. Create the folder if it does not exist.
- **Screen mode:** print the full audit in the session, write nothing. Trigger it the same way as the review skill: an argument like `screen` / `no-file`, phrasing like "just show me", or when run by another Claude instance consuming the result from the conversation.

## Step 1 — Collect the evidence

Working directory is `src/`; the git root is `C:/Code/FatCat.Toolkit`.

1. **List every report** in `vulnerabilities/unresolved/` and `vulnerabilities/resolved/` (`*.md`, excluding `audits/`). If both folders are empty or missing, tell the user there is no review history yet — suggest running `/code-security-review` first — and stop. Do not write an empty audit.
2. **Parse each report's header:** Run datetime, Branch, Commit, Reviewed (file count), Result (finding counts by severity), Status (`UNRESOLVED` or `RESOLVED (<date>)`).
3. **Parse each report's findings:** number, title, severity, CWE ID, OWASP category, file, and the summary-checklist state (checked = fixed, unchecked = open). Findings in `unresolved/` reports with unchecked boxes are the **currently open** set.
4. **Establish dates:**
   - Report creation = the Run datetime in its header.
   - Resolution = the date in `RESOLVED (<date>)`. If a resolved report is missing that date, fall back to git: `git log --follow --diff-filter=R --format="%as" -- src/vulnerabilities/resolved/<file>.md` (the rename commit). If the file was never committed, note the date as unknown rather than guessing.
5. **Record current context:** today's date via `pwsh -Command '. $PROFILE; (Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")'`, current branch, current `HEAD` short hash, the datetime of the most recent review run, and the shipped `VersionPrefix` from `ToolKit/ToolKit.csproj`.
6. **Cross-report dedup for metrics:** reports intentionally repeat still-open findings from earlier runs. When counting *distinct* findings over time, treat findings with the same file + CWE + title as one finding first seen at its earliest report; when counting *per-run* results, use each report as-is. Say which basis each metric uses.

## Step 2 — Compute the metrics

Compute honestly; where data is thin (few runs, unknown dates), say so instead of extrapolating.

- **Cadence:** number of review runs, date of first and latest, average gap between runs, longest gap. Staleness: days since the last full review as of today.
- **Volume:** distinct findings ever raised, by severity and by CWE/OWASP category (which weakness classes recur).
- **Resolution:** distinct findings resolved vs open; time-to-resolution per finding (first-seen date → resolution date) with median and worst; count resolved within 7 / 30 days.
- **Current posture:** open findings right now by severity — the headline number. Zero open Critical/High is the claim worth making when it is true.
- **Trend:** per-run open-finding counts in date order — improving, flat, or worsening.
- **Shipped-version exposure:** because this is a published package, a fixed finding only reaches consumers when a new version ships. Where you can tell from the reports and `VersionPrefix`, note whether resolved findings are in a released version or only on a branch. If you cannot tell, say so — do not imply consumers are covered.

## Step 3 — Write the audit

Order: posture first, evidence second, methodology and limits last. Use the template below.

In file mode, after writing, give the user the path plus a two-line summary: the headline posture and the trend.

### Audit template

```markdown
# Security Audit — FatCat.Toolkit

- **Generated:** <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss>
- **Branch / commit at audit time:** <branch> / <short hash>
- **Shipped version at audit time:** <VersionPrefix>
- **Review history:** <N> full-source reviews, <first date> → <latest date>
- **Generated by:** `/security-audit` (rollup of `/code-security-review` reports)

## Current posture

<One short paragraph, plain language: what is open right now by severity, when the last
full review ran, and the trend. This is the paragraph an external reader takes away.>

| Severity | Open now | Ever raised | Resolved |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | <n> | <n> | <n> |
| High | <n> | <n> | <n> |
| Medium | <n> | <n> | <n> |
| Low | <n> | <n> | <n> |

## Open findings

<One line per currently open finding: severity, CWE, file, title, first seen date, which
report it lives in. "None" when the table above shows zero open.>

## Review cadence

<Runs to date, average and longest gap, days since the last review. Flag staleness plainly:
an audit over stale reviews describes the past, not the present.>

## Resolution performance

<Median and worst time-to-resolution, counts resolved within 7/30 days, and any finding
open longer than 30 days called out individually.>

## Recurring weakness classes

<Top CWE/OWASP categories by distinct-finding count — where this codebase's mistakes
cluster, and whether recent reviews still raise them.>

## Consumer exposure

<This is a published NuGet package. State which fixes are in a released version and which
exist only on a branch, or say plainly that the reports do not carry enough information to
tell. A fix that has not shipped does not protect a consumer.>

## Timeline

| Run | Branch | Commit | Findings (C/H/M/L) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <date> | <branch> | <hash> | <c>/<h>/<m>/<l> | <resolved date or open count> |

## Methodology

<How reviews are produced: full-source scans (never diff-scoped), knowledge base (OWASP
Top 10 / ASVS, Microsoft Secure Coding Guidance, CWE Top 25, CodeQL query classes), every
finding classified by CWE and OWASP, resolution requires green build and tests
(`dotnet build src/ToolKit.slnx` / `dotnet test src/ToolKit.slnx`) before a report moves to
resolved/. Reports are committed to the repository, so the trail is tamper-evident through
git history.>

## Limits of this audit

This section is mandatory and must not be softened:
- Reviews are performed by an AI assistant (Claude) against recognized taxonomies; they are
  self-attestation, not an independent assessment.
- Absence of findings is evidence of diligence, not proof of security; no review method can
  prove the absence of vulnerabilities.
- Coverage between runs is not continuous — code merged after the latest review date is
  unreviewed until the next run.
- The reviews cover this library's source only. They say nothing about how a consuming
  application uses it, or about the security of its transitive dependencies beyond what
  `dotnet list package --vulnerable` reports.
- <Any data gaps found in Step 1: unknown resolution dates, uncommitted reports, etc.>
```

## Hard rules for this skill
- **Read-only outside `vulnerabilities/audits/`.** Never edit source code, never create/modify/move/delete review reports, never touch `unresolved/` or `resolved/` contents.
- **Never run a new review** or re-review source files to "fill gaps" — this skill reports on the record that exists. If the record is stale or thin, say so; the remedy is `/code-security-review`, offered to the user, not done implicitly.
- **Never overstate.** No security scores, letter grades, or certification language ("secure", "compliant", "audited by"). State counts, dates, and trends; the Limits section is never omitted.
- **Do not commit anything.**
- The audit never reproduces secret values, key material, or certificate contents — reference files and identifiers only.
