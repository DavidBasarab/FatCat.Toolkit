# What NOT to Do

These are hard stops. Do not do any of the following under any circumstances.

## Type System
- Do NOT use nullable annotations (`?`) anywhere — `string?`, `ILogger?`, `int?` are all banned
- Do NOT use records — use classes only

## Async
- Do NOT use `async void` — always return `Task` or `Task<T>`
- Do NOT use `ConfigureAwait(false)` — we do not use it
- Do NOT block on tasks with `.Result` or `.Wait()`
- Do NOT use `Task` or `Thread` directly for threading — use `IThread`

## Code Style
- Do NOT use expression-bodied members (`=>` syntax for methods or properties) — this applies to ALL access levels (public, private, protected, internal) and ALL projects including test projects
- Do NOT use query syntax LINQ (`from x in y where...`) — method chaining only
- Do NOT use string concatenation with `+` — use string interpolation
- Do NOT abbreviate names — write them out fully
- Do NOT write comments explaining what code does — rename until obvious

## Architecture
- Do NOT use property injection or setter injection — constructor only
- Do NOT use `new` inside a class to instantiate a dependency
- Do NOT name a file after an interface — always name after the class
- Do NOT add abstractions or patterns that do not exist in the surrounding codebase
- Do NOT introduce over-engineering — match the abstraction level of the existing code

## Errors & Logging
- Do NOT throw exceptions for predictable, known failure states — return an enum
- Do NOT swallow exceptions silently
- Do NOT use `DevLog` in permanent code — development debugging only, remove before merge

## Formatting
- Do NOT manually fight CSharpier formatting — it is the final authority
- Do NOT suppress ReSharper warnings without a comment explaining why
